# Customer-Order-Data-Analytics

Case Study #2

There is 1 dataset(csv) with 3 years worth of customer orders. There are 4 columns in the csv dataset: index, CUSTOMER_EMAIL(unique identifier as hash), Net_Revenue, and Year.
For each year we need the following information:

•	Total revenue for the current year

•	New Customer Revenue e.g. new customers not present in previous year only

•	Existing Customer Growth. To calculate this, use the Revenue of existing customers for current year –(minus) Revenue of existing customers from the previous year

•	Revenue lost from attrition

•	Existing Customer Revenue Current Year

•	Existing Customer Revenue Prior Year

•	Total Customers Current Year

•	Total Customers Previous Year

•	New Customers

•	Lost Customers

Additionally, generate a few unique plots highlighting some information from the dataset. Are there any interesting observations?
